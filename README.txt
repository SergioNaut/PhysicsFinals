Hi professor

Program runs in DEBUGx64 and RELEASEx64
In Release it creates a Deployment Folder and adds the relevant files to it.
This Folder is used by the InstallerScript.nsi (located in the Project Directory)
to create a folder with Installer and Uninstaller.

Currently the exe file is only showing a black screen, and I'm not sure what's happening.
But I believe both processes are correct.

The program has customizable projectiles.
You can change what model they will have, their mass and radius by changing the XML file.

The objects I created to test physics were a Cube, something that works like ballons, being pushed up but being
thethered to a point in the ground, and a bridge with 2 platforms.
The second platform was kinda of a last minute thing so it doesn't show in the video.

I struggled really hard with graphics classes this semester so the graphics programming are similar to what you showed
in class but I did change some things.

Controls:

Camera is moved with mouse
WASD Changes the Pitch and Yaw values for the projectiles
1,2,3  shoots the different projectiles.
